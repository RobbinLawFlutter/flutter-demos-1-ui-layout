//In this app we create our own class called MyApp.
//runApp will instantiate this MyApp into a Widget object
//and run it.
//The extends key word means that we are inheriting
//from the StatelessWidget class. Inheritance is a
//pillar of OOP.
//The @override keyword means that we are changing
//the base classes build method to our own. This is an example
//of polymorphism. This is another pillar of OOP.
//This will return our produced MaterialApp Widget tree.
